# Java-Array_Duplicate_Removal
This Java program removes duplicate elements from an array, ensuring only unique values remain. It takes user input for the array size and elements, processes them to filter out duplicates, and displays the result. The logic involves nested loops for checking duplicates and storing unique elements in a new array. ðŸš€
